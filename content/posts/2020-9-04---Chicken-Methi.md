5. Once the oil has separated from the the tomato mixture, add the chciken breast pieces and coat them with the tomato mixture

6. Add 1 cup of hot water and stir well. Put the lid on the pan and let the curry simmer for 20 minutes on a low-medium heat, stirring regularly. Add more water depending on how runny you prefer the gravy to be

7. Take the lid off the pan and add 1 tablespoon of kasthuri methi. Allow the curry to continue to simmer with the lid off for 7 minutes

8. Sprinkle the curry with finely chopped coriander and it's ready to serve with fresh chapatis and/or rice!
